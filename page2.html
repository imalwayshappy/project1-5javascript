				<h1>This is my Educational story: </h1>
				<h2><strong> Process: </strong> </h2>
				<div>
					<p>I remember learning about computer science through my best friend. 
						We were both 16th and in the same high school. Eventually, in college, 
						I took a different route. He kept insisting me to go, but I never did. .</p>
				</div>
				<div class="hide">
					<p>A few years later, I took his advice; it was late at night; he gave me a call, 
					but it then transitioned into a video call where he lectured me again. I took his advice,
					but then I stopped again. Ten years later, I am back in college. .</p>

				<h2><strong> Education: </strong></h2>
				<div>
					<p> My computer science education has been all over the place. 
						I majored in biblical studies; initially, I wanted to do that, then go out and work at a church. 
						But my story turned upside down; covid came, and two years in covid, I started to take a course 
						online.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="hide">
					<p> I then transitioned to a community college and here I am. 
						I am much ready than before. I am focused; I now know who I am, what I’ve done and where
						I am headed to. I had no idea that my best friend ended up working at Google. 
						I also receive tutoring.
